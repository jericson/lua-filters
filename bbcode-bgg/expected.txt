I wrote a [url=https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html]Pandoc filter[/url] for converting a variety of documents into Board Game Geek posts. It helps me because I prefer to use Markdown when I write and I’m tired of reformatting by hand when I’m ready to post to BAG. The filter can also help if you have content in one of the other [url=https://pandoc.org/index.html]input formats Pandoc accepts[/url], including HTML.

To use the filter, first [url=https://pandoc.org/installing.html]install pandoc[/url], download the filter and then run:

[c]
pandoc -t bbcode-bgg.lua [FILES]
[/c]

Notes:

[heading]One level of headers[/heading]

BGG only supports a single level of header. So this will flatten any structure you might have.

* [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Forum_Formatting#toc13]Lists aren’t directly supported.[/url] I’m just faking them. I don’t like the way they look [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1004108/forum-formatting-example-simple-list-using-cc-tags]using code formatting[/url] so I don’t do that.

1. Numbered lists aren’t supported either.
2. But again, I can fake them.
* Links are inserted as-is. Links to BGG items (such [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/151022/baseball-highlights-2045]Baseball Highlights: 2025[/url]) can be generated with [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Forum_Formatting#toc3]special BGG tags[/url], but that’s a little on the complicated side, so I don’t (yet?) support that.
* Images can be external to BGG. The filter doesn’t use the special tags for images hosted on BGG.

* I like footnotes, but BGG doesn’t support them. (Footnotes are included as parentheticals instead. This might not be what you want.) 
* Obviously you can have [b]bold[/b], [i]italic[/i], [-]strikethrough[/-] and [u]underline[/u] if you need them. Some of those styles aren’t supported by all input formats, however.

As I frequently say:

Quotations work, but you’ll need to add your own attribution to BGG content.
